# What is React

## Introduction

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components by Facebook Inc. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.

## History of React

- React was invented by Facebook developers who found the traditional DOM slow. By implementing a virtual DOM, React addressed this issue and gained popularity rapidly.
- The current stable version of ReactJS is 18.2.0, released on June 14, 2022. The library continues to evolve, introducing new features with each update.

## How does React work?

React operates by creating an in-memory virtual DOM rather than directly manipulating the browserâ€™s DOM. It performs necessary manipulations within this virtual representation before applying changes to the actual browser DOM. React is efficient, altering only what requires modification.

## Features of React

- **JavaScript Library:** Open-source library advanced by using Facebook.
- **User Interface Building:** Used for constructing dynamic and interactive user interfaces in applications.
- **Component-Based:** Allows you to create reusable UI components for modular improvement.
- **Virtual DOM:** Optimizes rendering via the usage of a virtual representation of the DOM i.e. virtual DOM.
- **Declarative Syntax:** Describes the support UI outcome, simplifying code and rebuilding.
- **Efficient State Management:** Provides mechanisms for managing issue domain correctly.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Data updates in a single direction, assist traceability and information.
